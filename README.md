# 🧍‍♂️ Real-Time Pose Detection using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe & Flask

This project demonstrates **real-time human pose detection** using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, served through a **Flask web application**.  
The app captures live video from a webcam (built-in or USB) and detects key body landmarks.  
Users can toggle **skeleton** and **keypoints** visibility directly from the browser interface.
